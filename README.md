This telecom company project focuses on examining customer churn through parametric models and Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) computations. The primary goals involve constructing Accelerated Failure Time (AFT) models using different distributions, evaluating and selecting the most suitable model. Moreover, it includes determining CLV based on the chosen model, investigating CLV across diverse customer segments, and offering insights into factors impacting churn risk.
